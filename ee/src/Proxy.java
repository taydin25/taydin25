/**
 * The Proxy creates a Server Socket which will wait for connections on the specified port.
 * Once a connection arrives and a socket is accepted, the Proxy creates a RequestHandler object
 * on a new thread and passes the socket to it to be handled.
 * This allows the Proxy to continue accept further connections while others are being handled.
 * 
 * The Proxy class is also responsible for providing the dynamic management of the proxy through the console 
 * and is run on a separate thread in order to not interrupt the acceptance of socket connections.
 * 
 * The Proxy server is also responsible for maintaining cached copies of the any websites that are requested by
 * clients and this includes the HTML markup, images, css and js files associated with each webpage.
 * 
 * Upon closing the proxy server, the HashMaps which hold cached items and blocked sites are serialized and
 * written to a file and are loaded back in when the proxy is started once more, meaning that cached and blocked
 * sites are maintained.
